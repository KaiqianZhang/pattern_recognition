The exponential family of distributions over $\boldsymbol{x}$, given parameters $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, has the following form:

$$
p(\bs{x}|\bs{\eta}) = h(\bs{x})g(\bs{\eta})\text{exp}\{\bs{\eta}^T\bs{u}(\bs{x})\},
$$
where $\bs{\eta}$ are called *natural parameters* of the distribution. 

## Sigmoid and softmax function

+ **Sigmoid function**: derived from $\eta$ from Bernoulli distribution $\text{Bern}(x|\mu)$:

$$
\mu = \sigma(\eta) = \frac{1}{1+\text{exp}(-\eta)}.
$$

+ **Softmax function**: derived from $\eta_k$ from multinomial distribution $\text{Multinomial}(x|\mu_1, \dots, \mu_k)$:

$$
\mu_k = \frac{\text{exp}(\eta_k)}{1+\sum_j \text{exp}(\eta_j)}.
$$

## Conjugate prior

For any member of the exponential family, there exists a conjugate prior that has the form:

$$
p(\bs{\eta}|\bs{\chi}, \nu) = f(\bs{\chi}, \nu) g(\bs{\eta})^{\nu} \text{exp}\{\nu \bs{\eta}^T \bs{\chi}\} .
$$
