# Notation

+ $\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathbb{R}^D, \boldsymbol{\mu} \in \mathbb{R}^D, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\in \mathbb{R}^{D\times D}$.

# Central limit theorem

**Intuition**: The central limit theorem (due to Laplace) tells us that, subject to certain mild conditions, the sum of a set of random variables, which is of course itself a random variable, has a distribution that becomes increasingly Gaussian as the number of terms in the sum increases (Walker, 1969).  

# Multivariate Gaussian distribution

For a D-dimensional vector $\boldsymbol{x}$, the multivariate Gaussian distribution pdf has the density (a scalar!):

$$
\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}}\frac{1}{|\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|^{1/2}}\text{exp}\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})\right\}.
$$
