**Logistic sigmoid function**: Sigmoid means S-shaped. a.k.a. squashing function because sigmoid function maps the whole real axis into a finite interval. 

$$
\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1+\text{exp}(-a)}.
$$
Properties of logistic sigmoid function:

+ This function is observed as the posterior probability for class $\mathcal{C}_1$: $p(\mathcal{C}_1|\boldsymbol{x})$.

+ Symmetry property: $\sigma(-a) = 1 - \sigma(a)$.

+ Inverse: $a = \text{ln}(\frac{\sigma}{1-\sigma})$, which is known as *logit* function.

**Normalized exponential function**: a.k.a. *softmax function*. For $K>2$ classes, the posterior probability is 

$$
p(\mathcal{C}_k|\boldsymbol{x}) = \frac{\text{exp}(a_k)}{\sum_j \text{exp}(a_j)}.
$$
